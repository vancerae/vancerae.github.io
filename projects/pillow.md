I made this Hawaiian quilt pillow—kapa kuiki—with three sets of hands and one line of moʻokūʻauhau. My mother guided me on FaceTime, talking me through each stitch and turn; my son drew the leaves that became the single-cut appliqué. I translated his lines into a folded paper template, cut the motif as one piece, needle-turned it to the ground cloth, and echo-quilted the ripples that radiate from the design.
The work was selected for Pūpū A ʻO ʻEwa: Native Hawaiian Writing and Arts as “Three Generations.” It’s a small object that holds a bigger lesson from Hawaiian Studies: ʻike kūpuna can travel by phone screen; pilina (relationship) is built in making; and kuleana (responsibility) is to pass knowledge forward, keiki to kūpuna and back again. The plant form keeps me grounded in ʻāina—a reminder that abundance is relational—and the close echo quilting marks each retelling of our family story.
