  <figcaption>Leaf motif by my son; stitching with my mom on FaceTime—three generations in one pillow.</figcaption>
</figure>

I made this Hawaiian quilt pillow—*kapa kuiki*—with three sets of hands and one line of *moʻokūʻauhau*. My mother guided me on FaceTime, talking me through each stitch and turn; my son drew the leaves that became the single-cut appliqué. I translated his lines into a folded paper template, cut the motif as one piece, needle-turned it to the ground cloth, and echo-quilted the ripples that radiate from the design.

The work was selected for **Pūpū A ʻO ʻEwa: Native Hawaiian Writing and Arts** as “Three Generations.” It’s a small object that holds a bigger lesson from Hawaiian Studies: *ʻike kūpuna* can travel by phone screen; *pilina* (relationship) is built in making; and *kuleana* (responsibility) is to pass knowledge forward, keiki to kūpuna and back again.
