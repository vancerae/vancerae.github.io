<h2>Three Generations</h2>
<p>I made this Hawaiian quilt pillow—<em>kapa kuiki</em>—with three sets of hands and one line of <em>moʻokūʻauhau</em>. My mother guided me on FaceTime, talking me through each stitch and turn; my son drew the leaves that became the single-cut appliqué. I translated his lines into a folded paper template, cut the motif as one piece, needle-turned it to the ground cloth, and echo-quilted the ripples that radiate from the design.</p>

<p>The work was selected for <strong>Pūpū A ʻO ʻEwa: Native Hawaiian Writing and Arts</strong> as “Three Generations.” It’s a small object that holds a bigger lesson from Hawaiian Studies: <em>ʻike kūpuna</em> can travel by phone screen; <em>pilina</em> (relationship) is built in making; and <em>kuleana</em> (responsibility) is to pass knowledge forward, keiki to kūpuna and back again.</p>
